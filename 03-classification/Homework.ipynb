    "### Summary and Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Data Quality is Key:** A significant number of records had missing `industry` data. How we handle such missing data is a critical first step in any ML project.\n",
    "2.  **Highly Correlated Features:** The strong correlation (~0.91) between `lead_score` and `number_of_courses_viewed` suggests multicollinearity. For simpler models, we could consider removing one of these features.\n",
    "3.  **Lead Source is Informative:** `lead_source` was the most predictive categorical feature according to the mutual information score. This is a valuable business insight, suggesting that the origin of a lead is a strong indicator of its potential to convert.\n",
    "4.  **A Simple Model Can Be a Strong Baseline:** A standard logistic regression model achieved a high baseline accuracy of **84%**, proving that it's a powerful and interpretable starting point.\n",
    "5.  **Optimization is an Iterative Process:** Feature engineering, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning (like adjusting `C`) are essential steps to refine a model. In our case, we found that `C=1` provided the optimal performance on the validation set.```"
